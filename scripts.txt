IOlib

The IOlib file is used to read a .msh file. The .msh file consists of a list of arrays, and IOlib translates these arrays to node ID's, node coordinates and elements.

MeshDat

The MeshDat file contains all the data structures that are used for the FEM simulation. It allows nodes and elements to be added and combines these to create a mesh. It also supports different types of elements. 

FEM

The FEM file contains all functions that are necessary to perform the FEM simulation. The function Distribute_Force is used to distribute the input force over the edge of the plate. The function getF is used to create force vector F in the system of equations. GetK creates the stiffness matrix. Using solveSys the system of equiations is solved to get the displacement in all the nodes and finally get_FEM_stresses is used to translate these displacements to stresses.
