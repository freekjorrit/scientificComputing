\chapter{Objective}
This is a reattempt for the course Scientific Computing. We did not finish the previous attempt because there were some problems within the group and this is our second take at the assignment with a small part of the group. The objective of this course was shortly described in a meeting. The details will be listed here again.

This time we needed to code a program which was able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item FEM calculations: The program must be able to solve a linear FEM
\item Triangular Elements
\item Arbitrary Mesh. The program should work for different meshes. Size of orientation should not matter. Also structured or unstructured mesh.
\item Boundary conditions. In the program the left hand side is fixed and a constant, equal distributed force acts on the right hand side.
\item The result must be exported to Paraview. Stress and displacement included.
\end{itemize}
