\section{Analytical solution}
To test the FEM solution analytically, a plate of length 1 m and height 1 m is loaded in the x direction with a force of 100 kN. A graphic representation of this problem can be found in the image below.

This is a thin plate and therefore plane stress can be assumed. In plane stress the following relation holds:
\[\sigma=\varepsilon*E\]
The value of the Young's modulus is 70 GPa. The stress is calculated by dividing the force by the length of the side of the plate. From this a strain of \(1.4286*10^{-6}\) can be found. 
In the FEM the left side of the plate is constrained in the x direction and the force is applied to the right side. The displacement of the right side of the plate due to this force is also \(1.4286*10^{-6}\), exactly the same as the analytical solution.
