\chapter{Results}
This chapter contains the results of both the mesh generation, which serves as input for the FEM calculation, and the results of the FEM calculations themselves

\section{Mesh generation}
As mentioned before the generation of the mesh is done using a separate program called Gmsh. In Gmsh a geometry is created which is then used to generate a mesh. This mesh can then be saved as a .msh file. Figure \ref{Gmsh}(a) shows the used geometry, and figure \ref{Gmsh}(b) shows the mesh resulting from this geometry. In this geometry the bottom left corner is fixed completely while the rest of the left hand side is only fixed in the x direction. A force is then placed on the right hand side.

\section{FEM}
The resulting mesh is saved in a .msh file which is read by the FEM code. The code then does all the required calculations as described previously and the results are exported to Paraview. The resulting images are shown below. Figure \ref{Disp} shows the displacement data and figure \ref{VonMises} shows the Von Mises stress. In figure \ref{VonMises2} the force is increased to show the displacements in the material. Linear material behavior is assumed.

In figure \ref{VonMises} the stresses are high at the sides of the large hole. To get more detailed information the mesh should be refined in this areas. This is however outside the scope of this assignment. Mesh refinement was however already done in the previous assignment.
